# Beisner2003.jl

A quick implementation of [VARIABILITY OF LAKES ON THE LANDSCAPE: ROLES OF PHOSPHORUS, FOOD WEBS, AND DISSOLVED ORGANIC CARBON](https://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9658(2003)084[1563:VOLOTL]2.0.CO;2).

A transient version is in `beisner.jl`, with a steady state validation in `steady_state.jl` - which re-implements figure 3 from the paper.
